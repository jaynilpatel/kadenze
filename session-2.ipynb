    "In this assignment, we're going to create our first neural network capable of taking any two continuous values as inputs.  Those two values will go through a series of multiplications, additions, and nonlinearities, coming out of the network as 3 outputs.  Remember from the last homework, we used convolution to filter an image so that the representations in the image were accentuated.  We're not going to be using convolution w/ Neural Networks until the next session, but we're effectively doing the same thing here: using multiplications to accentuate the representations in our data, in order to minimize whatever our cost function is.  To find out what those multiplications need to be, we're going to use Gradient Descent and Backpropagation, which will take our cost, and find the appropriate updates to all the parameters in our network to best optimize the cost.  In the next session, we'll explore much bigger networks and convolution.  This \"toy\" network is really to help us get up and running with neural networks, and aid our exploration of the different components that make up a neural network.  You will be expected to explore manipulations of the neural networks in this notebook as much as possible to help aid your understanding of how they effect the final result.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to build our first neural network to understand what color \"to paint\" given a location in an image, or the row, col of the image.  So in goes a row/col, and out goes a R/G/B.  In the next lesson, we'll learn what this network is really doing is performing regression.  For now, we'll focus on the creative applications of such a network to help us get a better understanding of the different components that make up the neural network.  You'll be asked to explore many of the different components of a neural network, including changing the inputs/outputs (i.e. the dataset), the number of layers, their activation functions, the cost functions, learning rate, and batch size.  You'll also explore a modification to this same network which takes a 3rd input: an index for an image.  This will let us try to learn multiple images at once, though with limited success.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll now dive right into creating deep neural networks, and I'm going to show you the math along the way.  Don't worry if a lot of it doesn't make sense, and it really takes a bit of practice before it starts to come together."

    "Create the operations necessary for connecting an input to a network, defined by a `tf.Placeholder`, to a series of fully connected, or linear, layers, using the formula:  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\textbf{H} = \\phi(\\textbf{X}\\textbf{W} + \\textbf{b})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\textbf{H}$ is an output layer representing the \"hidden\" activations of a network, $\\phi$ represents some nonlinearity, $\\textbf{X}$ represents an input to that layer, $\\textbf{W}$ is that layer's weight matrix, and $\\textbf{b}$ is that layer's bias.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If you're thinking, what is going on?  Where did all that math come from?  Don't be afraid of it.  Once you learn how to \"speak\" the symbolic representation of the equation, it starts to get easier.  And once we put it into practice with some code, it should start to feel like there is some association with what is written in the equation, and what we've written in code.  Practice trying to say the equation in a meaningful way: \"The output of a hidden layer is equal to some input multiplied by another matrix, adding some bias, and applying a non-linearity\".  Or perhaps: \"The hidden layer is equal to a nonlinearity applied to an input multiplied by a matrix and adding some bias\".  Explore your own interpretations of the equation, or ways of describing it, and it starts to become much, much easier to apply the equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing that happens in this equation is the input matrix $\\textbf{X}$ is multiplied by another matrix, $\\textbf{W}$.  This is the most complicated part of the equation.  It's performing matrix multiplication, as we've seen from last session, and is effectively scaling and rotating our input.  The bias $\\textbf{b}$ allows for a global shift in the resulting values.  Finally, the nonlinearity of $\\phi$ allows the input space to be nonlinearly warped, allowing it to express a lot more interesting distributions of data.  Have a look below at some common nonlinearities.  If you're unfamiliar with looking at graphs like this, it is common to read the horizontal axis as X, as the input, and the vertical axis as Y, as the output."

    "Remember, having series of linear followed by nonlinear operations is what makes neural networks expressive.  By stacking a lot of \"linear\" + \"nonlinear\" operations in a series, we can create a deep neural network!  Have a look at the output ranges of the above nonlinearity when considering which nonlinearity seems most appropriate.  For instance, the `relu` is always above 0, but does not saturate at any value above 0, meaning it can be anything above 0.  That's unlike the `sigmoid` which does saturate at both 0 and 1, meaning its values for a single output neuron will always be between 0 and 1.  Similarly, the `tanh` saturates at -1 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing between these is often a matter of trial and error.  Though you can make some insights depending on your normalization scheme.  For instance, if your output is expected to be in the range of 0 to 1, you may not want to use a `tanh` function, which ranges from -1 to 1, but likely would want to use a `sigmoid`.  Keep the ranges of these activation functions in mind when designing your network, especially the final output layer of your network."

Basically, we're trying to see on average, or at least within a single minibatches average, how wrong was our prediction?  We create a measure of error for every output feature by squaring the predicted output and the actual output it should have, i.e. the actual color value it should have output for a given input pixel position.  By squaring it, we penalize large distances, but not so much small distances.\n",

For example if my prediction was (120, 50, 167), and the color should have been (0, 100, 120), then the error for the Red channel is (120 - 0) or 120.  And the Green channel is (50 - 100) or -50, and for the Blue channel, (167 - 120) = 47.  When I square this result, I get: (120)^2, (-50)^2, and (47)^2.  I then add all of these and that is my error, $\\textbf{E}$, for this one observation.  But I will have a few observations per minibatch.  So I add all the error in my batch together, then divide by the number of observations in the batch, essentially finding the mean error of my batch.  \n",

But the $l_2$ loss is $0.1^2 = 0.01$.  Having a stronger penalty on smaller errors often leads to what the literature calls \"sparse\" solutions, since it favors activations that try to explain as much of the data as possible, rather than a lot of activations that do a sort of good job,  but when put together, do a great job of explaining the data.

You'll need to refer to the `Y` and `Y_pred` variables only, and your resulting cost should be a single value.

This is done by taking random subsets of the entire dataset.  For instance, we partition our dataset by saying we'll only use 80% of it for training, 10% for validation, and the last 10% for testing.  Then when training as above, you would only use the 80% of the data you had partitioned, and then monitor accuracy on both the data you have used to train, but also that new 10% of unseen validation data.  This gives you a sense of how \"general\" your network is.  If it is performing just as well on that 10% of data, then you know it is doing a good job.  Finally, once you are done training, you would test one last time on your \"test\" dataset.  Ideally, you'd do this a number of times, so that every part of the dataset had a chance to be the test set.  This would also give you a measure of the variance of the accuracy on the final test.  If it changes a lot, you know something is wrong.  If it remains fairly stable, then you know that it is a good representation of the model's accuracy on unseen data.\n",

So for any given row, col, we'd have 100 possible r, g, b values.  This likely won't work very well as there are many possible values a pixel could take, not just one.

The only difference now is that you are able to try this with a few images at a time.  There are a few ways we could have tried to handle multiple images.  The way I've shown in the `train` function is to include an additional input neuron for *which* image it is.  So as well as receiving the row and column, the network will also receive as input which image it is as a number.
